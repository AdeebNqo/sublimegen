1. The logic behind providing the "groups" or patterns uses
paranthesis for identifying the sections to be highlighted, however,
it does not account for when there is a ?, + or * after the closing brace.
Fix this! [FIXED]

2. When the groups list has one item, check if it is not only group 1. It seems to be redundant.
To fix or not fix? [FIXED]

3. Investigate whether sublime text priorritizes matching using position on the plist. [DONE]

8. Order regexes properly

9. Organize code -- make it look cleaner
